      <section>
        <p>The late Canadian typographer Carl Dair was one of the great typographic designers of the 1950s and 1960s, and he may have been the best of them all at explaining the nature of typography. In coordinated projects that he both wrote and designed, he managed to describe — and show — the ways in which manipulating and using type make typography happen.</p>

        <p>Dair is the very epitome of what I mean when I say <strong class="accent">“typographer”</strong>: someone who designs with type, not just a fancy typesetter, but someone who uses type, in all its variations, as the principal element of design. Since type carries meaning, the practice of typography requires a designer who cares about the words themselves. It requires someone who cares enough, and is skillful enough, to make the type express that meaning, rather than serve as simply eye-catching decoration.</p>

        <p>Carl Dair’s book <em>Design With Type</em> (originally published in 1952; revised and expanded in 1967) is deservedly still in print, even though the technology that he used and described has long been outdated. The visual relationships between letters, which Dair showed so graphically, haven’t changed. <strong class="accent">Design with type</strong> remains a fundamental skill for designers.</p>

        <h2>Harmony and Contrast</h2>
        <p>The heart of Dair’s teaching is found in “Typographic Contrast.” He compares typography to music: rhythm and emphasis, harmony and contrast are fundamental to both. The booklet shows how designers use visual contrast to make meaning pop out — clearly and with flair.</p>

        <h2>Seven Kinds of Contrast</h2>

        <h3>Contrast of Size</h3>
        <p>A simple but dramatic change in size provides a point to which the reader’s attention is drawn. Large titles paired with smaller text create hierarchy and rhythm.</p>

        <h3>Contrast of Weight</h3>
        <p>Bold type stands out in the middle of lighter type of the same style. Weight can be used to make anchors and emphasis within a passage.</p>

        <h3>Contrast of Form</h3>
        <p>Form is the distinction between capitals and lowercase, roman and italic, or condensed and expanded faces. These changes in shape create visual contrast without changing the type family.</p>

        <h3>Contrast of Structure</h3>
        <p>Structure contrasts different letterforms and type families (for example, a monoline sans vs. a high-contrast serif). It changes the very quality of the voice on the page.</p>

        <h3>Contrast of Texture</h3>
        <p>Texture is how blocks of type read as a mass — the fabric formed by lines and counters. Line length, spacing and type choice alter the page’s texture.</p>

        <h3>Contrast of Color</h3>
        <p>Color (including tonal value) shifts emphasis. Even subtle changes in tone can alter perceived importance; choose color and tone carefully.</p>

        <h3>Contrast of Direction</h3>
        <p>Direction plays with alignment and angle. The opposition between vertical and horizontal, or a single rotated word, can add energy and emphasis.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="closing">
        <p>There are other contrasts — isolation of an element, paper and ink choices, or illustrations that either harmonize or contrast with the type. Dair also speaks to rhythm and the power of interrupted rhythm: the unexpected placement that breaks an otherwise steady pattern.</p>

        <p class="note"><span class="dir">→</span> Most successful designs combine several contrasts to create clear, purposeful typographic “chords.”</p>
