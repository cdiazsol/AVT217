    <h1>Seven Principles of Typographic Contrast</h1>

    <div class="content">
      <p>In a seminal booklet that he both designed and wrote, Carl Dair showed how in typography, as in music, harmony and contrast are the keys to composition.</p>
      <p>The late Canadian typographer Carl Dair was one of the great typographic designers of the 1950s and 1960s, and he may have been the best of them all at explaining the nature of typography...</p>

      <p>Dair is the very epitome of what I mean when I say "typographer": someone who designs with type, not just a fancy typesetter...</p>

      <p>Carl Dair's book "Design With Type" (originally published in 1952; revised and expanded in 1967) is deservedly still in print...</p>

      <p>At around the same time he was revising his book, Carl Dair was producing a series of six pamphlets for West Virginia Pulp and Paper (Westvaco)...</p>

      <h2>Harmony and Contrast</h2>
      <p>The heart of Carl Dair's teaching — the thing that I keep pointing people to, and the most valuable thing I myself learned from his work...</p>

      <h3>Seven Kinds of Contrast</h3>
      <p>Dair first explains the "elements of harmony"... then goes on to show seven different kinds of contrast.</p>

      <h4>Contrast of Size</h4>
      <p>The first and most basic contrast is size...</p>

      <h4>Contrast of Weight</h4>
      <p>The second most obvious contrast is of weight...</p>

      <h4>Contrast of Form</h4>
      <p>By "form," Dair means the distinction between a capital letter and its lowercase equivalent...</p>

      <h4>Contrast of Structure</h4>
      <p>By "structure," Dair means the different letterforms of different kinds of typefaces...</p>

      <h4>Contrast of Texture</h4>
      <p>Put all these things together, and apply them to a block of text on a page...</p>

      <h4>Contrast of Color</h4>
      <p>Dair's sixth contrast is color — and he warns that a second color is usually less emphatic...</p>

      <h4>Contrast of Direction</h4>
      <p>The last of Dair's seven kinds of contrast is the contrast of direction...</p>

      <h4>Other Types of Contrast</h4>
      <p>There are other kinds of contrast, less clearly dependent on the type itself...</p>
      <p>Most of the time, we use more than one kind of contrast together...</p>
